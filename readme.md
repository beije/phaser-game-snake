# Snake made in Phaser #

This is a small game of [Snake](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)) made with the game engine [Phaser](http://phaser.io/).

I've documented the game creation on my blog, [Creating the game Snake with Phaser](http://benjaminhorn.io/code/creating-the-game-snake-with-phaser/).

There's a live preview of the game [here](http://www.deepwinter.se/data/phaser-game-snake/).
